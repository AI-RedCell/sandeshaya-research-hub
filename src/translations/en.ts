  // About Sandeshaya
  'about.title': 'About Sandeshaya',
  'about.para1': 'Organized by the Ananda College Broadcasting Unit, the \'Sandeshaya Awards Ceremony\' is a national-level youth media program with a unique ability to evolve and respond meaningfully to the changing requirements of the media sector in Sri Lanka.',
  'about.para2': 'Established in 2006, Sandeshaya has been a unique program that has moved through constant innovation. Not limited to one fixed format, its structure has evolved over the years to serve the Sri Lankan media field in a timely, relevant and powerful way. Beginning as Sri Lanka\'s largest school media day festival, it created a unique platform for student media activities.',
  'about.para3': 'In 2011, Sandeshaya expanded as a formal national program that brought students\' perspectives into a broader media discourse. Marking a significant milestone in 2012, Sandeshaya launched Sri Lanka\'s first media research project conducted by a school media organization, setting a precedent for academic engagement with media studies among the youth.',
  'about.para4': 'Continuing this evolutionary journey, Sandeshaya has redirected its direction to a new dimension this time. This year\'s program primarily focuses on a island-wide research project seeking the views of Sri Lankan school students on media ethics and the need for more robust media regulation. The information obtained through this study is to be presented to relevant stakeholders with the aim of making a creative contribution to the national discourse.',
  'about.para5': 'Going beyond traditional evaluation formats, Sandeshaya today as a platform based on research and dialogue, empowers the voice of the younger generation on media responsibility, credibility and social impact.',
  'about.para6': 'The ceremony also features the presentation of awards for ISAC’25, Sri Lanka\'s largest school media competition dedicated to identifying and honing talents in the school media field.',
  'about.para7': 'The future of Sri Lanka\'s media landscape is further reflected in Sandeshaya through the power of youth voice, critical thinking and purposeful intervention.',
  'unit.title': 'Ananda College Broadcasting Unit',
  'unit.para1': 'Founded on November 1, 1886, during a period of national resurgence, Ananda is a golden milestone in the history of Sri Lankan education. Among the student organizations in this supreme educational center that builds a generation of students enriched with Buddhist philosophy, virtue and wisdom, the Ananda College Broadcasting Unit can be considered as a golden mark.',
  'unit.para2': 'Established in 1973, the College Broadcasting Unit has gone down in history as a pioneer organization that has paved new paths in the field of school media for over 50 years. The Ananda College Broadcasting Unit\'s excellence is evidenced by the successful organization of many special occasions in the annual calendar, such as the Ananda\'s Best Announcer Competition, the Inter-School Announcing Competition, and the nationally recognized Sandeshaya Awards Ceremony.',
  'unit.para3': 'The strength of the Ananda College Broadcasting Unit, which has built a valuable platform for young media artists across the country to express their abilities through these programs, lies in the unity of its members. Under the guidance of teachers and the leadership of the Principal, this unit builds the personality of the students based on the basic trio of discipline, announcing and organization. Beyond the school boundaries, the voice of the Ananda College Broadcasting Unit constantly resonates in international stages.',
  'unit.para4': 'Choosing members of the Ananda College Broadcasting Unit as announcers for international events such as the 2002 Asian Games and the 2006 South Asian Games was a tribute to its excellence. Furthermore, the unit has been associated with leading media organizations in Sri Lanka through television and radio programs like Child Garden, We Are the World, and Child News. In particular, the Ananda College Broadcasting Unit\'s role as the official volunteer announcing unit (NIFF) for the United Nations in Sri Lanka (UN) is the highest evidence of its reliability.',
  'unit.para5': 'The Ananda College Broadcasting Unit is a unit that has built not only announcers but individuals who shape society. Lighting the present with the heritage of the past, as the voice personality of Ananda moving directionally towards the future, may the Ananda College Broadcasting Unit continue to shine for long, spreading Ananda\'s fame everywhere with the help of Ananda mother!',

  // About Research
  'research.title': 'About the Research',
  'research.objective_title': 'Research Objective',
  'research.objective_text': 'The purpose of this study is to investigate how Sri Lankan School Students view the ethical standards that the nation\'s media organizations currently uphold. It aims to comprehend how young audiences assess media content in terms of social impact, responsibility, fairness, and accuracy. The study also looks at students\' perspectives on the need for more robust, updated, or efficient media laws in Sri Lanka, with a focus on how these laws might encourage moral journalism and safeguard young media consumers. By using this method, the study hopes to shed light on young people\'s opinions regarding media responsibility and the future course of media governance in Sri Lanka.',
  'research.who_title': 'Who Can Participate',
  'research.who_text': 'This survey is intended for Sri Lankan schoolchildren, particularly those enrolled in grades 6 through 13. Students from national schools, provincial government schools, private schools, and international schools are all welcome to participate. To ensure wide geographic representation and a variety of viewpoints that reflect the diverse educational and social backgrounds of Sri Lankan schoolchildren, students from every province in the nation are encouraged to participate.',
  'research.why_title': 'Why This Research Matters',
  'research.why_text': 'In today\'s society, young people are among the most engaged and powerful media consumers, using social media, print, digital, and television on a daily basis. Despite this high level of involvement, their opinions are frequently ignored or underrepresented in national conversations about media responsibility, ethics, and regulation. By giving schoolchildren a specific forum to share their opinions and experiences, this study aims to close that gap. It gives young people the chance to express their opinions about media accountability, legitimacy, and reliability, as well as the moral principles they believe Sri Lankan media organizations should follow when providing services to the public.',
  'research.how_title': 'How Results Will Be Used',
  'research.how_text': 'The results of this study will significantly advance Sri Lanka\'s national conversation on media ethics and media governance. The research will help educators, legislators, media professionals, and pertinent regulatory bodies understand the expectations, experiences, and ethical concerns of the nation\'s student population by showcasing the opinions and concerns of schoolchildren. These observations can help make better decisions, promote ethical media practices, and direct the creation of laws and educational programs that more accurately represent the requirements and ideals of Sri Lanka\'s youth media consumers.',
